üöó Automatic Vehicle Accident Detection and Alert System

üìã Project Overview
The Automatic Vehicle Accident Detection and Alert System is an IoT-based solution designed to enhance road safety by promptly detecting accidents and sending alert notifications with location details. This project demonstrates the potential of IoT in creating smart, responsive systems for critical scenarios.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
Real-Time Accident Detection: Utilizes the ADXL335 accelerometer to identify collision impact.
Location Tracking: Determines the precise accident location using the NEO GPS6M module.
Immediate Notifications: Sends SMS alerts to emergency responders and family members via the GSM SIM800I module.
Compact and Efficient Design: Employs the ESP32 microcontroller and 2596 DC to DC converter for seamless integration and reliable performance.

üñ•Ô∏è Technology Stack
Microcontroller: ESP32
Modules Used:
GSM SIM800I for communication
NEO GPS6M for location tracking
ADXL335 accelerometer for accident detection
Power Supply: 2596 DC to DC converter

üîß Working Procedure
Accident Detection: The ADXL335 accelerometer detects an impact.
Data Processing: The ESP32 processes the detected signal.
Location Identification: The GPS module retrieves the accident location.
Alert Notification: The GSM module sends an SMS alert containing the location to emergency services and relatives.

üì¶ Installation and Setup
